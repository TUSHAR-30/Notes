//Procedure for getting the files from the user.
// Store the file in server.
// Store the same file in cloudinary.
// Add the url returned by cloudinary in the database.
// Delete the file from server.




// To send files through a form, you need to use the multipart/form-data encoding type. This encoding allows for both binary data (like files) and text data (like input fields) to be properly packaged and transmitted.

// For the server to handle the file, you'll need middleware to parse multipart/form-data. For example, in Node.js with Express, you can use the multer package to handle file uploads.
// After using multer, the rest of the form data (non-file data) will be available in req.body as usual.

// .Also in order to save the file with prefix random value + file name ; we can either use Math.random or we can use vvid here.

// In order to save this server stored file in cloudinary, we need cloudinary.

// In order to save the url returned by cloudinary for the file in the mongodb database, we will use mongoose.

// In order to delete the file from server  we need nodejs inbuilt module "fs" which will delete file from server.
